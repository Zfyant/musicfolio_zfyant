# 🎧 Zetch’s Musical DNA

Meet your music identity on one beautiful page. [VIEW HERE!](https://zfyant.github.io/musicfolio_zfyant/)

**Zetch’s Musical DNA** is a sleek, single-page dashboard that turns your liked songs into a **personal music profile** — complete with a live playlist, top artists, genres, eras, and “who you are in music form.”

## ✨ What This Page Does

* Shows off your **Spotify taste** in a bold, aesthetic way
* Embeds a **live playlist** so people can listen while they scroll
* Breaks your vibe into:

  * 🎨 Your core **artists**
  * 🎛️ Your signature **genres**
  * 📊 Your favorite **eras & stats**
  * 🎵 Standout **tracks**

It’s like a **music portfolio** instead of just a static playlist link.

## 💡 Why It’s Awesome

* **Great for sharing** on portfolios, dating profiles, social bios, or link-in-bio pages
* **Instantly “gets you”** — visitors don’t have to guess your vibe
* Feels like a **Spotify Wrapped**, but permanent and beautifully curated
* 100% front-end — easy to host anywhere as a simple static site

---

## 🚀 How You Can Use It

* As your **personal music landing page**
* As a **template** to generate “Music DNA” pages for friends or clients
* As a **fun add-on** to a personal website, portfolio, or digital business card

Just drop it on a static host (or your own server), change the copy and playlist link, and it’s ready to show off.
